# Math Operator

 ## The usage of the basic math operators, including:
---
* ```+ ```(add),
* ```- ```(subtract),
* ```* ``` (multiply),
* ```/ ``` (divide),
* ```% ``` (modulo),
* ```** ``` (power),
* ```//```(floor rounding)


We will also focus on the use of useful math functions, including:

* max() (maximum value),
* min() (minimum value),
* abs() (absolute value),
* pow() (value to the power of the value),
* ceil() (rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer),
* floor() (rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer).
